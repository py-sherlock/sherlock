Sherlock: Distributed Locks with a choice of backend
====================================================

:mod:`sherlock` is a library that provides easy-to-use distributed inter-process
locks and also allows you to choose a backend of your choice for lock
synchronization.

Overview
--------

When you are working with resources which are accessed by multiple services or
distributed services, more than often you need some kind of locking mechanism
to make it possible to access some resources at a time.

Distributed Locks or Mutexes can help you with this. :mod:`sherlock` provides
the exact same facility, with some extra goodies. It provides an easy-to-use API
that resembles standard library's `threading.Lock` semantics.

Apart from this, :mod:`sherlock` gives you the flexibilty of using a backend of
your choice for managing locks.

:mod:`sherlock` also makes it simple for you to extend :mod:`sherlock` to use
backends that are not supported.

Features
++++++++

* API similar to standard library's `threading.Lock`.
* Support for With statement, to cleanly acquire and release locks.
* Backend agnostic: supports `Redis`_, `Memcached`_ and `Etcd`_ as choice of
  backends.
* Extendable: can be easily extended to work with any other of backend of
  choice by extending base lock class. Read :ref:`extending`.

.. _Redis: http://redis.io
.. _Memcached: http://memcached.org
.. _Etcd: http://github.com/coreos/etcd

Supported Backends and Client Libraries
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Following client libraries are supported for every supported backend:

* Redis: `redis-py`_
* Memcached: `pylibmc`_
* Etcd: `python-etcd`_

.. _redis-py: http://github.com
.. _pylibmc: http://github.com
.. _python-etcd: https://github.com/jplana/python-etcd

As of now, only the above mentioned libraries are supported. Although
:mod:`sherlock` takes custom client objects so that you can easily provide
settings that you want to use for that backend store, but :mod:`sherlock` also
checks if the provided client object is an instance of the supported clients
and accepts client objects which pass this check, even if the APIs are the
same. :mod:`sherlock` might get rid of this issue later, if need be and if
there is a demand for that.

Installation
------------

Installation is simple.

.. code:: bash

    pip install sherlock

.. note:: :mod:`sherlock` will install all the client libraries for all the
          supported backends.

Basic Usage
-----------

:mod:`sherlock` is simple to use as at the API and semantics level, it tries to
conform to standard library's :mod:`threading.Lock` APIs.

.. code-block:: python

    import sherlock
    from sherlock import Lock

    # Configure :mod:`sherlock`'s locks to use Redis as the backend,
    # never expire locks and retry acquiring an acquired lock after an
    # interval of 0.1 second.
    sherlock.configure(backend=sherlock.backends.REDIS,
                       expire=None,
                       retry_interval=0.1)

    # Note: configuring sherlock to use a backend does not limit you
    # another backend at the same time. You can import backend specific locks
    # like RedisLock, MCLock and EtcdLock and use them just the same way you
    # use a generic lock (see below). In fact, the generic Lock provided by
    # sherlock is just a proxy that uses these specific locks under the hood.

    # acquire a lock called my_lock
    lock = Lock('my_lock')

    # acquire a blocking lock
    lock.acquire()

    # check if the lock has been acquired or not
    lock.locked() == True

    # release the lock
    lock.release()

Support for ``with`` statement
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: python

    # using with statement
    with Lock('my_lock'):
        # do something constructive with your locked resource here
        pass

Blocking and Non-blocking API
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: python

    # acquire non-blocking lock
    lock1 = Lock('my_lock')
    lock2 = Lock('my_lock')

    # successfully acquire lock1
    lock1.acquire()

    # try to acquire lock in a non-blocking way
    lock2.acquire(False) == True # returns False

    # try to acquire lock in a blocking way
    lock2.acquire() # blocks until lock is acquired to timeout happens

Using two backends at the same time
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Configuring :mod:`sherlock` to use a backend does not limit you from using
another backend at the same time. You can import backend specific locks like
RedisLock, MCLock and EtcdLock and use them just the same way you use a generic
lock (see below). In fact, the generic Lock provided by :mod:`sherlock` is just
a proxy that uses these specific locks under the hood.

.. code-block:: python

    import sherlock
    from sherlock import Lock

    # Configure :mod:`sherlock`'s locks to use Redis as the backend
    sherlock.configure(backend=sherlock.backends.REDIS)

    # Acquire a lock called my_lock, this lock uses Redis
    lock = Lock('my_lock')

    # Now acquire locks in Memcached
    from sherlock import MCLock
    mclock = MCLock('my_mc_lock')
    mclock.acquire()

Tests
-----

To run all the tests (including integration), you have to make sure that all
the databases are running. Make sure all the services are running:

.. code:: bash

    # memcached
    memcached

    # redis-server
    redis-server

    # etcd (etcd is probably not available as package, here is the simplest way
    # to run it).
    wget https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/<version>/etcd-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf etcd-<version>-<platform>.gz
    ./etcd-<version>-<platform>/etcd

Run tests like so:

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py test
